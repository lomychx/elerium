# Elerium

Elerium is a UI library for Roblox Lua, designed to make creating user interfaces easier and more intuitive. It provides a set of functions for creating windows, tabs, and various UI elements such as labels, buttons, text boxes, switches, sliders, keybinds, dropdowns, color pickers, and consoles.

To create a new window, use the `AddWindow` function:

```lua
local window = library:AddWindow("My Window")
```
